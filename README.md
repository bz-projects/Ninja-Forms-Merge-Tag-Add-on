Ninja is a great plugin to create easily now form and application, but if you want to display some things into the mail, you must write new tags and more. With Ninja Forms Merge Tag Addon you can add the post content from your single page into your Post Type. Ninja Forms can read it and give it in your Admin Mail. In the next updates I work for more Ninja Forms Tags.
